    "However, we need some way to parametrize the mass and light given the number of galaxies and redshift. After all, we are creating mass and light profiles so that PyAutoLens can perform raytracing. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the results from [https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/444554/pdf]:\n",

    "#### Simulation\n",
    "Since PyAutoLens does not have formal support for creating galaxy clusters, we have to create each individual galaxy. We can break this down into mass profiles, and light profiles. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the mass profile, the NFW dark matter halo will dominate the galaxy cluster's mass distribution. The percentage that it take is approximately 90%.\n",

    "(https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2642-9)\n",
    "Therefore, we can accurately model the mass profile with the dark matter halo NFW. Perhaps we can try adding in a small correction due to some extraneously dense galaxy, but such an implementation is not necessary for now. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need to model the light profile. This one is more tricky, for obvious reasons. \n",
    "Naively, we can create a random sersic light profile for every single galaxy in the cluster, add all the galaxies to our galaxy cluster, and we have a light profile for our cluster. However, this is computationally expensive and not exactly accurate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some facts we know about galaxy clusters, their member galaxies and their light profiles. \n",
    "- They can be described by sersic profiles\n",
    "\n",
    "- There exists a \"brightest\" galaxy within the cluster, positioned near the center of the cluster, which can take up to 36% of the total light profile. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0001415)\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are a range of luminous galaxy members, but we will proceed by truncating their contributions under a certain apparent magnitude. This is to reduce computaional intensity. We can allow the medium range luminous galaxies to have a light profile within a certain random range. \n",

    "\n",
    "Now, we need to get the flux to pixel ratio correct. After all, these are going to be placed into the background of images from the merged catalog of DESI + Subaru legacy surveys. \n",
    "From what I can see, this has to be aligned with the pixel scales from marco's images. \n",
